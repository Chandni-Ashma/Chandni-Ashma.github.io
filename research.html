<p><b>A GIS-based DRASTIC model for assessing
groundwater vulnerability in Magura and Narail districts of Bangladesh </b><br>


<b>Abstract</b> :

<span id="bsh" style="display: none">

Around 97% of population of Bangladesh relies on groundwater for potable supplies (Jiang et al., 2012). It is also extensively used for irrigation in the south-west region of the country specially during the dry season. Therefor pollution of ground water is a crucial issue for us. There are many reasons behind it. In this study, the pollution potential of two districts, Magura and Narail in the south-west of Bangladesh has been determined using DRASTIC indices. DRASTIC is a methodology that systematically evaluates the pollution potential of an area. It has two major parts: the designation of hydrogeologic settings and superposition of relative ratings. Hydrogeologic settings include depth to ground-water, net recharge, aquifer media, soil media, topography, impact of vadose zone media and hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer and ultimately forming the acronym DRASTIC. It is then combined with weights and ratings to produce drastic index value. The DRASTIC index value range for Magura and Narail districts are  105-165  and  99-142 respectively which indicates that Magura has low to high vulnerability while Narail is very low to moderately vulnerable to contamination. As the objective of the study was to determine which parts of the area is more vulnerable to ground water contamination than others, so the study areas were reclassified into five (very low, low, moderate, high, very high) zones. It shows that in Magura 1.0% area is very highly vulnerable, 16.1% area is highly vulnerable, 30.4% area is moderately vulnerable while 52.1% area lies under low vulnerability and 0.4% area under very low vulnerability. On the other side in Narail district only 0.3% area is highly vulnerable, most of which lie in the Singasolpur union of the district. Narail sadar upazilla shares a major part of the moderately vulnerable zone while other places of this district falls mostly under very low to low vulnerability. From the observation it is also found that in both the districts there is small urban areas where pollution potential is very low due to covered soil surface as waste materials canâ€™t seep through it. It is hoped that this study will be helpful in future development and landuse planning of this area and also assist in prioritizing protection, monitoring and cleanup efforts. </span>
