<b>Abstract</b> : 

<span id="c1h" style="display: none"> 

In modern days, we have to be in touch with various high-tech machineries and equipments to get our jobs done and make our lives easier. Too often these machineries serve very important purposes and sometimes require continuous monitoring. But it is not always feasible to be physically near to the system. So, to be in touch with this sort of important systems by not being physically close, we need some sort of remote solution. The remote solution should unleash the restrictions due to physical distance yet provides enough reliability even from distance. <br><br>

We came to know about some commercially available products which allow remote systems controlling through internet. Internet is undoubtedly emerging; yet, it lacks the true sense of real mobility and security, making the remote system controlling a limited term than it is supposed to be. <br><br>

In search of true a remote and adequately secure solution to be really effective and practicable, which can be a better choice to mobile telephony? Mobile phones have become almost an inseparable part of civil lives today. We are all familiar with the CALL and SMS services of mobile phones and use it extensively in our daily lives. Also enhanced data rate services like GPRS and EDGE are common in today's world and it brings the internet to the mobile phones. Keeping the mobile telephony in mind, we tried to analyze the existing services and solutions to the problem of true remote system controlling and came up with some innovative ideas to utilize the power of mobile telephony. We researched and implemented the mechanism so that the ordinary services of the mobile phones can be leveraged to communicate with and control the remote systems. </span>
